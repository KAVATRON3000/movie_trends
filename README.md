Analysis of Trends in the Movie Industry

An exploratory data analysis of The Movies Dataset from Kaggle. This project uses Python, pandas, and Matplotlib to clean and analyse metadata for over 5000 movies to uncover insights into genre popularity, profitability, and industry growth over the years.

### Key Findings:

1. **Production volume != profitability!**
   Drama is the most produced genre, yet it doesn't appear in the top 10 most profitable genres.
2. **Animation and Adventure lead in financial success**
   Genres typically associated with massive blockbuster films such as Animation and Adventure, generate the highest average profit per film.
3. **The film industry has grown exponentially over time**
   The number of movies released annually has skyrocketed, particularly in the last two decades.
